          Hi! I'm an 18-year-old student, developer, and tech enthusiast who's super curious about how technology, especially AI and 3D, can shape the future. I love exploring cool ideas and figuring out how to turn them into real, working projects.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-5 transition-colors duration-300 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Whether it's building something from scratch, experimenting with new tools, or learning about the latest tech trends, I'm always excited to try new things. I'm also really interested in startups and how technology can be used to solve real-world problems in creative ways.
        </p>
        
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors duration-300 leading-relaxed text-sm">
          Right now, I'm focused on learning as much as I can, building fun and useful stuff, and connecting with others who are just as passionate about tech as I am. My goal is to keep growing, keep building, and maybe even launch something awesome one day.
